Minimax algorithm
 Uses DFS to explore the tree
 Both players maximize

alpha beta pruning

value of alpha is -inf, beta is +inf
a is the best value the maximizer can achieve
beta is the best value the minimizer can achieve

Alpha must choose the maximum of its children, beta chooses the minimum for its children
