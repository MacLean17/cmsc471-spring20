### About CMSC 471

This course serves as an introduction to Artificial Intelligence concepts and techniques. We will cover most of the material in our text, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, including the agent paradigm in AI systems, search, game playing, knowledge representation and reasoning, natural language processing, planning, machine learning, and philosophical issues. See the schedule for a more detailed breakdown but be aware that the order and timing is subject to change.

This is an upper-level undergraduate Computer Science course and we will assume that you will have a good grounding in algorithms and adequate programming skills. Many of the homework assignments will involve programming and you will be expected to do them in Python.

### Text Books

We will be using the following Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, second edition. This edition has been out for many years, so you should be able to find used copies available to borrow or buy.

### Q&A and Discussion

We will be using Slack for class discussion. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. E-mail Don for an invite.

### Schedule
A tentative schedule is available, but we will adapt this as we go along. Check this every week.

### Grading

Grades will be based performance on assigned homework, a mid-term examination, a final examination, and a final project. The exact weight will be set at the end of the course, but the expected breakdown is

    projects: 60%
    midterm: 20%
    final: 20%

As per University policy, incompletes will be granted only under extraordinary circumstances; students who are enrolled after the last day to drop a class should be prepared to receive a grade of A-F.

### Projects

There will a number of projects/homework assignments and will be the main source of your grade. Each assignment will have approximately two weeks to complete and will come out approximately once a week.


### Exams

The material covered by the exams will be drawn from assigned readings in the text, from lectures, and from the projects.


### Academic Honesty

We will follow a policy described in this statement adopted by UMBC's Undergraduate Council and Provost's Office.

In general, the expectations for projects are that you are allowed to talk to your peers, explain things to one another, suggest things, whatever. If you work with someone else in this way mark down your list of collaborators on your homework assignment so that the grader doesn't think the collaboration is fishy. If you use an online source, external library, stackoverflow answer, whatever, cite your source. Where I draw the line is copy/pasting anything from your peers. 

*By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC's scholarly community, in which everyone's academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal. To read the full Student Academic Conduct Policy, consult the UMBC Student Handbook, the Faculty Handbook, or the UMBC Policies section of the UMBC Directory.* 

*Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. In particular, all assignments are to be your own work. You may discuss the assignments with anyone. However, any help you receive must be documented. At the beginning of each assignment, you must include a comment indicating the sources you used while working on it (excluding course staff and text), and the type of help you received from them. Failure to include such a statement will result in the assignment being returned ungraded. You may resubmit such a returned assignment once over the course of the semester.*

*Written answers on essay questions for homeworks and papers must be your own work. If you wish to quote a source, you must do so explicitly, using quotation marks and proper citation at the point of the quote. Plagiarism (copying) of any source, including another student's work, is not acceptable and will result in at a minimum a zero grade for the entire assignment. Please review this overview of how to correctly cite a source and these guidelines on acceptable paraphrasing.*

### Software

Many of the assignments will involve programming and/or using software packages and we will assume that everyone has a basic familiarity with Python. It is your responsibility to find a computer that can appropriately run the homework assignments, but if you need assistance in finding one let Don know.
