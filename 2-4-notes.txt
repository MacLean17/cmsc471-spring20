Notes for February 4th: SEARCH

Problem Space definition
 - A set of states   >> how do you represent state of the world? >> what is the goal / end state?
 - Operators that change from one state into another >> how do we encode these? >> discrete events
 - Constraints for when you can do operators >> what is legal?
 - Control knowledge for deciding what to apply next
 
 8-puzzle
 
 5 4 _   1 2 3
 6 1 8   8 _ 4
 7 3 2   7 6 5
 
 4 possible moves for each of the 8 tiles... or move the space for just 4 moves
 
 
 Deterministic?
 What state results next?
 
 
 Size of a problem? Possible number of states
  Tic Tac Toe has about 3^9 states
  Checkers has about 10^40 states
  Rubiks Cube has 10^19
  Chess has 10^120
  Go has 2 * 10 ^ 170
 
Representational efficiency
 - Removing illegal states. how many does tic tac toe really have? only 593
 
 
 Jug problem
 - J1 and J2 with capacity C1 and C2, itially has W1 and W2 water
 - E.g., full 5 gallon jug and empty 2 gallon jug
 
 3 liter full jug, 1 liter full jug. want to have goal state of (1,1)
 
 show a tree
 show a graph
 
 
 
 state space graph is a graph (V,E)
 - V have state information in them
 - E are actions, each edge has a positive cost
 - start nodes, goal nodes
 
 
 Solution:
  - a path from the start to the end
 
 Solution Cost:
  - sum of costs along the solution
  
 State-space search: looking for a solution
 
 Uninformed Search: (no clue what comes next)
 BFS 
 DFS
 Iterative Deepening
 Option: Bidirectional search

 Informed search strategies: (heuristics)
 Hill climbing,
 A*
 
 
 Evaluation criteria:
 Completeness -- guarantees to find a solution whenever one exists
 Time comlexity -- number of nodes expanded
 Space complexity -- memory needed
 Optimality -- if a solution is found, how good is that solution
