Game Thory - figure out how agents interact in competitive and cooperative environments

- Strategic interactions
- Rational players
- Outcomes
- Players have preferences
- General theory for strategic behavior

Use cases:
- Economics
- Decision making

The model:
UTILITY -- players want to maximize utility 


Zero Sum Games:
- If one player wins, the other player loses.
- If you sum up utility, it adds up to 0
- Easier to analyze

"Games"
- rules: who can do what? when can they do it?
- strategy: what is the player going to do?
- player's payoff: how much that player gets for winning?
- dominant strategy: it doesn't matter what others do, it's always best to do that

Nash Equilibrium
- Optimal strategy based on strategies of other players
- no player benefits by  changing strategy
- Every fininte game has a nash equilbrium
- stable: obvious, weak: multiple options
- the maximum column of the cell and the maximum row of the cell is the nash equilibrium

Prisoner's dilemma
cooperate: moderate utility, defect: best utility, both defect: both bad.

            CONFESS       NOT

CONFESS     4 years each     1 year / 8 years

NOT        8 years / 1 year   3 years each

2,2   0,3
3,0   1,1

If clyde confesses, best thing for bonnie to do is to defect
If clyde does not confess, best thing for bonnie to do is to defect

Trade wars
arms races
Advertising: expensive, everyone advertising equalizes, better off if nobody advertised

Rowing a boat
Stag hunt is pareto optimal
Showing up to a party on time
risk dominant picks 2,2
 
 Iterative prisoners dilemma
 - always defect
 - always cooperate
 - Randomly choose
 - Pavlovian -- cooperate, and switch to always defect when defected on
 - Tit for tat - do what the previous player did on the previous round
 - Joss - TFT but 10% of the time defect
 - Collusion
