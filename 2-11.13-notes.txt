Optimization / Search algorithms:

  Gradient Descent
   - Step size based on the multi-dimensional gradient
   - gamma "amplifies" the step
   - next _x = current_x - gamma * df(current_x)

  Simulated Annealing
   - randomly selects a solution close to the current one
   - measures its quality
   - change the probability of accepting bad solutions decreases, probability dependent on the better solution found
   - accepting worse solutions a % chance of the time

  Ant Colony Optimization
   - lots of ants
   - ants walk randomly but are "attracted for pheramones"
   - environment has pheramone amounts on them -- stronger is more attractive
   - pheramones evaporate
   - been applied to routing problems, protein folding, tsp
   - parallel implementations
   - can handle dynamic changes to graphs

  Genetic Algorithms
   - genetic representation of a problem
   - a fitness function
   - initialization
   - selection -- select to breed a new generation
   - breeding -- more than two parents? breeding strategies
   - mutation
   - mutation rate / crossover probability all important to tweak
